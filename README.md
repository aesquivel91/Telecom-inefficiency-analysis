# Telecom Inefficiency Analysis 

Exploratory analysis of telecom operator inefficiencies. 

The project identifies high missed call rates, routing problems, and areas for service optimization.

### Contents
- `notebooks/telecom_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with EDA and hypothesis tests.
- `reports/` — Visualizations and summary of key findings.
- `.gitignore` — To exclude heavy datasets and system files.

### How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tu_usuario/telecom-inefficiency-analysis.git
   cd telecom-inefficiency-analysis```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run de notebook in `notebooks/`.

### Results
- Missed calls > 30% in several operators.
- Routing issues concentrated in “Unassigned” category.
- Recommendations: improve routing rules, prioritize high-traffic operators.
